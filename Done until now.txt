5 Aprile
-Added various comments and understood basic flow of the code
-Modified bundle header in mypacket.h in order to hold a path vector
-GetSet of the new field
-Added trafficVolume field in the contact table file generator
-Adjusted accordingly the contact file reader to add the field in the 
contactTable structure
-Basic prototipe of routing functions

6 Aprile
-Started working on the SCGR algorithm
-Inverted the way the contact table is read, saving as my_address the RX IP
and in the in_contact_with_address the TX address of the other node

11 Aprile
-Completed SCGR algorithm
-Corrected several errors 

12 Aprile
-Completed correcting compiling errors
-Completed writing of support functions
-Commented useless parts

18 Aprile
-Beginning the of the necessary modifications in order to read
the path vector and route the bundle
-Functions that needed modifications:
	*CheckWiredBuffer
	*CheckWirelessBuffer
-Commented parts to be modified with the help of the PT

20 Aprile
-Actuation of the modifications
-Checked how the SCGR algorithm saves the path vector

26 Aprile 
-Final correction all related to the double IP interface
-Modified the SCGR and contact table generation because of this.

2 Maggio
-Corrected build errors
-First contact table created

3 Maggio 
-Corrected errors on contact table build

4 Maggio
